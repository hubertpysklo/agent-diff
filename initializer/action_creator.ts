Your job is to understand what kind of system this is (messaging, CRM, project management, etc.) and identify:
1. What ACTIONS can happen (based on tables and their relationships)
2. What SPACES exist for organizing visibility and context
3. How visibility is determined for each action

Key principles:
- Actions map to INSERT operations on tables (send_message â†’ INSERT INTO messages)
- Spaces are organizational boundaries (channels, threads, documents, projects)
- Visibility rules determine who sees what based on memberships, permissions, or recipients

Analyze the schema to find:
- Communication patterns (messages, emails, comments)
- Organizational structures (channels, groups, teams, projects)
- Permission systems (membership tables, access control)
- Content creation (documents, posts, tasks)

For each action, determine:
- What parameters it needs (actor, content, target)
- What entity it creates in the database
- How visibility is determined (channel members, recipients, permissions)
- Whether it can create new spaces

For spaces, identify if they are:
- Explicit: Have their own table (channels, projects, documents)
- Implicit: Emerge from relationships (email threads from reply_to)
- Derived: Computed from patterns (DM conversations from two-person visibility)`,

        prompt: `Analyze this database schema and extract the complete action space:

${schemaDescription}

Identify all possible actions users can take, what spaces exist for organizing content, and how visibility works for each action type.

Consider:
- Tables with foreign keys likely represent relationships and memberships
- Tables with user_id or similar columns are probably content created by users
- Junction tables often represent memberships or permissions
- Tables with parent_id or reply_to suggest threading/hierarchy

Generate a comprehensive action space that covers all interactions possible in this system.`,
