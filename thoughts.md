We are working on a project to create fake slacks and other universes, populate the DB on demand and then run tests on those fake universes through fake API. 

The part I am working on is the agent that will populate the DB. We should assume the other team will already intilize relevant tables for slack gmail and other services. (Probable we should query the DB to check the DB. schema and avaialble schemas?) Then we should populate them accoridng to user request, e.g. fake construction company with 3 employees. Then we should create tests for an AI agent, e.g. Send message to issac and expected change in populated DB. OR find poem in the general channel and send it as a DM to user X, and expected change in the DB - probably as an SQL query or how you suggest we should do it?

The next thing I am thinking is how we should make this agent. We should expect a super siimple terminal UI to run this intialization agent. I am thinking which SDK should we use, vercel ai sdk, open ai adk or langraph, and weather a tool should be a general SQL request tool or a separate tool for each SQL operation. We will recive DB url and API key from the other team when the intialization is compaleted.

Let's think through it

It looks that the data created by a single LLM and then populating them are really not close to reality, we need a generalizble way to create arbitraty synthetic data depending on the use case. I am thinking about a multiagent system talking to each other in turns, and some randomness, e.g. random selection of which agent now sends a message or updates a notion doucment or sends an email to another one. This seem to be really hard how would you approach it? think deeply about those kind of multi agent sumulations

Our role is for an arbitrary service like slack notion or gmail or any possible service, when recived a schema and an information that talbes are intialized, populate them with synetheic data based on user request

I dont think we really even need probailistic for action because LLMs are probabilitics themselfs, but probability to select which personality/ agent is loded as a system prompt at this turn


Like the orchestrator agent recives a DB schema created and a user request, e.g. simulate an AI company in san francisco

it then creates agents (not code ai agent but agents, like people with diffrent personalities)

Then there is a turning system to an LLM where there is e.g. a firdt person saying HI, then a probabilsitic model selects which enxt agent will reply to this message etc.

If we reach desired number of messages for instance or other paramter we stop, and another agent is reponsible for populating a DB with this data, even simple vercel AI sdk with Neon MCP to populate which recives the created data by agents and popultes the DB with it


The Revelation
Every multi-user database schema is fundamentally the same thing: a social interaction graph.
Whether it's Slack, Gmail, a CRM, or a medical system, they all reduce to:
WHO did WHAT, WHO can see it, and WHERE it happened
The Architectural Epiphany
Instead of building complex schema analyzers, domain interpreters, and orchestration layers, we need just:

One LLM call to create agents that understand the specific schema
A trivial loop that picks agents by probability and generates events
Events that only need 4 fields: actor, action, visibility, context_space

The Philosophical Insight
We kept adding complexity because we thought different services were fundamentally different. But at the data level, Slack isn't a "messaging app" and Gmail isn't an "email service" - they're both just:
Databases that track who told what to whom
The Engineering Wisdom
The entire system collapsed from hundreds of components to essentially:
pythonagents = llm("here's a schema, create personas")
while simulating:
    agent = random.choice(agents, weighted=True)
    event = llm(agent.prompt + recent_visible_context)
    database.insert(event)
The revelation: Complex systems aren't complex because they need to be. They're complex because we haven't found the right abstraction. Once you find it, everything becomes trivially simple.
In one sentence: All multi-user systems are just agents sharing information with controlled visibility - everything else is implementation detail.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
