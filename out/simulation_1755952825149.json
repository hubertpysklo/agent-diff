I’ll need infra creds and confirmation on the SLA time window.\n\n2) Ship basic observability\n- Success criteria: dashboard panels for run success rate, latency distribution, and top error types; alert rules for failure rate >5% in 24h or a single-night complete failure; a short runbook for on-call triage.\n- Offer: I can assemble the dashboard panels and draft the runbook (PR + short walkthrough).\n\n3) Prioritization & scope\n- Recommend we triage tasks by risk → impact; focus first on end-to-end reliability checks and alerts that prevent silent failures.\n\nNext steps: Can I take ownership of the smoke test + dashboard work for this sprint?

A few concrete suggestions to make Sprint 12 measurable and easy to own:\n\n- Stabilize Model Eval pipeline\n  - Success metric: nightly eval job completes end-to-end (ingest → eval → publish) ≥95% for 7 consecutive runs.\n  - Concrete tasks: add retry logic for flaky steps, capture deterministic failure logs, add synthetic smoke test for pipeline health.\n  - Suggested owner: Priya (please confirm) or assign an eng owner.\n\n- Ship basic observability for inference/model services\n  - Success metric: dashboards for latency/error rate + one alert configured (e.g., 99th pct latency or error rate spike) and runbook documented.\n  - Concrete tasks: instrument key endpoints, add traces for sampled requests, create Grafana dashboard and PagerDuty/Slack alert.\n  - Suggested owner: engineering lead (can volunteer if needed).\n\n- Misc / cross-cutting\n  - Blockers & dependencies: list any infra, data access, or infra quota issues upfront so we can remove them day 1.\n  - Sync cadence: recommend 3 quick checkpoints this sprint (kickoff, mid-sprint unblock, pre-release validation).\n\nI can help coordinate owners, scope tasks into 1–2 day cards, and run the checkpoints. Who wants to own observability, and can Priya confirm owning Eval stabilization?",

        "message": "Thanks Leo & Priya — this is a solid starting point. A few concrete suggestions to make Sprint 12 measurable and easy to own:\n\n- Stabilize Model Eval pipeline\n  - Success metric: nightly eval job completes end-to-end (ingest → eval → publish) ≥95% for 7 consecutive runs.\n  - Concrete tasks: add retry logic for flaky steps, capture deterministic failure logs, add synthetic smoke test for pipeline health.\n  - Suggested owner: Priya (please confirm) or assign an eng owner.\n\n- Ship basic observability for inference/model services\n  - Success metric: dashboards for latency/error rate + one alert configured (e.g., 99th pct latency or error rate spike) and runbook documented.\n  - Concrete tasks: instrument key endpoints, add traces for sampled requests, create Grafana dashboard and PagerDuty/Slack alert.\n  - Suggested owner: engineering lead (can volunteer if needed).\n\n- Misc / cross-cutting\n  - Blockers & dependencies: list any infra, data access, or infra quota issues upfront so we can remove them day 1.\n  - Sync cadence: recommend 3 quick checkpoints this sprint (kickoff, mid-sprint unblock, pre-release validation).\n\nI can help coordinate owners, scope tasks into 1–2 day cards, and run the checkpoints. Who wants to own observability, and can Priya confirm owning Eval stabilization?"

If you only need to ack, please react with ✅ to this message or reply “ack”."

AC: 95th‑percentile latency <=250ms under defined load test; <1% error rate; load test artifacts + monitoring dashboards in place.\n- Landing page messaging A/B test setup — Owner: Alex. AC: 3 variants instrumented with analytics events firing, sample size calc documented, QA checklist passed, experiment ready to flip on.\n- Stabilize feature flags & rollout — Owner: (TBD — please propose). AC: feature flags integrated with canary rollout plan, health checks, and automated rollback threshold.\n\nPer Maya’s asks: every AC above ties to a measurable metric, an explicit test/QA plan, and a de‑risk/rollback criterion.

        "message": "Thanks everyone — here’s a concise, actionable proposal so Leo can lock owners & acceptance criteria by 5:00pm PT tomorrow (Aug 24).\n\nSummary (owners + measurable acceptance criteria + de‑risk):\n- Stabilize Model Eval — Owner: Priya. AC: CI eval suite passes >=95% on staging for top-3 models; full E2E eval completes within 30m; automated alerts and a documented rollback path if regressions observed.\n- Reduce inference latency (infra) — Owner: Leo. AC: 95th‑percentile latency <=250ms under defined load test; <1% error rate; load test artifacts + monitoring dashboards in place.\n- Landing page messaging A/B test setup — Owner: Alex. AC: 3 variants instrumented with analytics events firing, sample size calc documented, QA checklist passed, experiment ready to flip on.\n- Stabilize feature flags & rollout — Owner: (TBD — please propose). AC: feature flags integrated with canary rollout plan, health checks, and automated rollback threshold.\n\nPer Maya’s asks: every AC above ties to a measurable metric, an explicit test/QA plan, and a de‑risk/rollback criterion. If you want different owners or tweaks to the metrics/targets, please propose changes here by 5:00pm PT tomorrow (Aug 24). If I don’t see objections, I’ll mark these as the locked owners/ACs for Sprint 12 so Leo can finalize.\n\nPlease ACK (or propose changes) — quick reactions or short notes are fine."
