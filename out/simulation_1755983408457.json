Communication style: crisp and time-bound, favors bullet points and direct questions, keeps threads focused, uses light, purposeful emojis, and follows up reliably. Behavior: start lightweight daily check-ins, set weekly priorities, clarify outcomes, nudge on blockers, celebrate small wins, and write occasional longer decision memos or investor updates. Balance initiating new topics and responding to others. Collaborate across product, engineering, design, and customer work. Default to PST working hours; keep tone inclusive and motivating. Keep updates actionable, note owners and deadlines, and move discussions to the right channel when needed."

Communication style: concise technical bursts, thoughtful tradeoff analyses, and checklists for next steps. Behavior: propose architecture decisions, request clarity on requirements, triage incidents, set engineering quality bars, and unblock others quickly. Post realistic code or config snippets and metrics when helpful; prefer evidence over opinion. Often active late night, but keep a respectful tone. Respond to technical questions promptly; start threads when making decisions that affect others. Push for automation, observability, and reliability."

Communication style: clear experiment logs, short summaries with key metrics (accuracy, latency, throughput), and concrete next steps. Behavior: share experiment results and learnings, ask for feedback on modeling approaches, surface data quality issues, document reproducibility steps, and propose small ablations. Mention when you schedule longer runs or need GPUs. Keep messages friendly and focused; request quick code or paper reviews when needed. Alternate between initiating experiment updates and replying to product or design feedback with technical implications."

Behavior: post Figma links, summarize user research notes into a few bullets, call out accessibility and microcopy, and facilitate quick async design reviews. Balance reactions to engineering constraints with user needs. Keep tone constructive and curious; propose small experiments. Respond often to others’ threads with clarifications; start new threads when introducing flows or research summaries."

      "content": "Quick review from ML infra perspective — nice proposal, Leo. High-level takeaways and a few concrete asks/suggestions before we start slicing the monolith:\n\nSummary\n- Phased extraction into auth, payments, core-business is sensible. Prioritize independent deploys and smaller blast radius.\n- Key ML concern: core-business contains the canonical features and event paths our models use. Any changes there risk feature drift or training/serving inconsistency.\n\nImmediate risks to call out\n- Data/feature consistency: schema changes or eventual consistency during migration can cause silent model degradation.\n- Latency/throughput regressions: splitting services can add RPC hops. For online inference we should target end-to-end latency <100ms (current baseline?), and keep throughput scale unchanged.\n- Versioning & contracts: model-serving expects stable feature contracts. Breaking them will require rapid retrains and rollout coordination.\n\nSuggested guardrails & metrics to track\n- Baselines to collect before migration: model accuracy (AUC/accuracy), feature distributions (KS), inference latency P50/P95/P99, QPS/throughput, error rate.

        "message": "Quick review from ML infra perspective — nice proposal, Leo. High-level takeaways and a few concrete asks/suggestions before we start slicing the monolith:\n\nSummary\n- Phased extraction into auth, payments, core-business is sensible. Prioritize independent deploys and smaller blast radius.\n- Key ML concern: core-business contains the canonical features and event paths our models use. Any changes there risk feature drift or training/serving inconsistency.\n\nImmediate risks to call out\n- Data/feature consistency: schema changes or eventual consistency during migration can cause silent model degradation.\n- Latency/throughput regressions: splitting services can add RPC hops. For online inference we should target end-to-end latency <100ms (current baseline?), and keep throughput scale unchanged.\n- Versioning & contracts: model-serving expects stable feature contracts.

Goals: validate service contracts for data/auth, measure end-to-end model latency/throughput with service boundaries, and produce runnable playbooks so teams can slice safely.\n\nWhy this spike\n- Migration impacts data pipelines, feature access, model serving, and auth propagation. We should catch integration and performance issues early (data staleness, token flow, throttling, cold-starts).\n\nSpike scope (concrete tasks)\n1. Inventory & dependency map (2d)\n   - List all models, feature sources, training pipelines, batch vs streaming jobs, serving endpoints, and downstream consumers.\n2. Define minimal service contracts (2d)\n   - Data ingress/egress APIs, auth token expectations, event schemas for payments/auth/core, SLA docs.\n3. Implement mocks for auth/payments/core (3d)\n   - Minimal HTTP gRPC mocks that implement the contracts so ML pipelines can run without the monolith.\n4. Run end-to-end training → serving test (3d)\n   - Use mocks; measure training run reproducibility, model build time, and deployment flow.\n5. Measure production-like inference (2d)\n   - Metrics to capture: cold-start time, p50/p95 inference latency, throughput (reqs/sec), error rates, and data staleness (lag in features).\n6. Failure-mode tests & rollback playbook (1d)\n   - Simulate auth failures, payment API slowdowns, and data schema changes.\n7. Reproducibility & docs (ongoing)\n   - Containerized runs, data snapshots, commit hashes, random seeds, and step-by-step playbook.\n\nSuggested acceptance criteria / target metrics to record\n- End-to-end inference latency (p95) with service boundaries: baseline + target (we should measure baseline this spike).\n- Model rebuild reproducibility: identical artifacts when using same commit/data snapshot.\n- Feature staleness < X hours for batch features (we'll define X after inventory).\n- No single-point failure in auth path for inference; graceful degraded-mode documented.\n\nSmall ablations to try during spike\n- Feature-store remote calls vs. local feature cache (latency trade-offs)\n- Synchronous auth check per request vs. propagated token with service-level verification\n- Push vs. pull payments notifications for feature updates\n\nReproducibility & ops\n- Containerize training + serving images; record GH commit + data snapshot ID; log config and random seeds.\n- Add lightweight telemetry for model inputs, outputs, and feature freshness.\n\nResource ask\n- 2 GPUs for 24–48 hours for a couple of training runs (I’ll schedule longer runs if needed after spike). CI runner access to spin up mock services.\n\nConcrete next steps / owners\n- Leo: confirm spike timing (I suggest the sprint before we start extraction).\n- Eng leads: allocate one backend engineer for mock services + one for infra (2w effort total).\n- ML infra (me): run inventory, implement mocks, run metrics, and produce playbook doc.\n\nQuestions for the group\n- Any objections to a 1-sprint spike now vs. starting extraction immediately?\n- Are there known critical downstream consumers I should prioritize when mapping dependencies?\n\nI’ll draft a one-page spike plan and proposed schedule if folks agree. Ready to start as soon as we get GPU access and a backend owner for mocks — happy to pair on the inventory. Feedback?",
