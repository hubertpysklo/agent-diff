High-level: the three directions are distinct and all solve different parts of the brief; we can move to client-facing refinement once we tighten composition and accessibility.\n\nWhat’s working\n- Distinct visual directions: each concept reads as a unique brand tone (heroic, intimate, and lifestyle). That gives us real choice for the client.\n- Strong focal hierarchy: focal points are clear and should work well across breakpoints.\n- Good starting assets: Alex’s comps give enough variation to A/B for photography vs illustration emphasis.\n\nWhat to refine (why it matters)\n- Contrast and legibility: ensure headline + CTA pass AA at minimum on each hero. This matters for conversion and accessibility.\n- Composition balance for header nav: the nav prototype (Sam) sits differently in each comp — we need to confirm safe zones so the nav never overlaps primary CTAs on smaller screens.\n- Imagery crop and focal point: for responsive behavior, lock a focal area and provide portrait/landscape crops so hero scales without losing intent.\n\nOptions and trade-offs (pick one)\n- Option A: Present all three to the client with recommended top 2. Pros: shows range; cons: can feel indecisive. My recommended pick: present 2 (the strongest concept + one contrasting direction).\n- Option B: Refine 1 concept into two variations (photo vs illustrated hero). Pros: clearer direction; cons: less exploration.\n\nRecommendation (my call, unless you object)\n- I want us to present 2 options to the client: Concept 1 (primary) + Concept 3 (contrasting). We’ll keep Concept 2 as a back-up iteration.\n\nConcrete next steps (owners & deadlines)\n1) Alex: Update the two chosen concepts with:\n   - WCAG AA checks for headline/CTA color combos (provide swatches)\n   - Locked focal crops for desktop/tablet/phone\n   - Export a Figma file and PNG/JPG previews\n   Due: Aug 25, 2025 EOD\n2) Sam: Validate header nav spacing and provide a short note on how nav should collapse/float across the two hero layouts. If any spacing changes are needed, flag them so Alex can adapt. Due: Aug 24, 2025 (end of day)\n3) Priya: Run the accessibility checklist against the two updated hero comps and confirm any fixes required for AA. Drop checklist comments in the same Figma file.

I’ll review by Aug 26, 2025 noon.\n\nDeliverables to attach to the client packet\n- Figma link with two final hero variants + notes\n- PNG previews at 1440/768/375 widths\n- Short rationale (1 paragraph per concept) explaining user outcome and KPI impact\n- Accessibility checklist excerpt showing pass/fail for headline & CTA\n\nAsk for the team\n- Alex: drop the Figma link here when updates are ready and tag Priya + Sam.\n- Everyone: If you disagree with the Recommended pick, reply with a quick note (Option A vs B) by Aug 24, 2025 12:00pm so I can decide before client packet prep.\n\nThanks — strong set of starts.

      "content": "Update: Quick recap and clear next steps for the hero concepts + client review pack\n\nContext: Alex has finalized 3 hero image concepts (desktop + mobile). Hannah asked for a client review pack to share internally. Mara asked for a quick review + clear next steps and cross-checks with Sam and me.\n\nDecision: Move the three directions forward to client review; prepare a concise review pack outlining each direction, recommended direction, and any cross-checks/interaction notes.\n\nNext steps / Action items:\n- Alex — Upload the 3 final comps (desktop + mobile) into the design folder and add a 1-line summary + your recommended direction (one sentence) by Mon, Aug 25 EOD. Owner: Alex. Due: 2025-08-25.\n- Sam — Cross-check header nav interactions with each hero direction and drop a short note about any alignment or interaction changes needed by Mon, Aug 25 EOD. Owner: Sam. Due: 2025-08-25.\n- Priya (me) — Assemble the client review pack (intro slide, 3 direction slides with 1-line summaries, recommended direction, accessibility notes, and next steps). I’ll also attach the accessibility checklist and key QA items. Draft ready for internal review by Tue, Aug 26 10:00 AM PT. Owner: Priya. Due: 2025-08-26 10:00 AM PT.\n- Team internal review — Everyone please review the assembled pack and post feedback in this thread by Tue, Aug 26 4:00 PM PT so I can finalize before client share. Owners: All. Due: 2025-08-26 4:00 PM PT.\n- Client review meeting — Propose Wed, Aug 27 10:00–11:00 AM PT or Thu, Aug 28 1:00–2:00 PM PT. Priya to confirm based on client availability after internal sign-off. Owner: Priya. Target: 2025-08-27 or 2025-08-28.\n\nBlockers / Risks:\n- I can’t assemble the review pack until Alex uploads comps and Sam confirms nav notes. If either slips, client review will shift by 24–48 hours.\n- Need client availability confirmed once internal review is complete.\n\nQuick asks now:\n1) Alex — confirm you’ll upload comps + 1-line summaries by Aug 25 EOD. Reply here with “Uploading” when you’ve started.\n2) Sam — confirm you’ll drop nav cross-check notes by Aug 25 EOD. Reply here with “Checking” when you’ve started.\n3) Everyone — flag any objections to the proposed client review window (Aug 27 morning PT or Aug 28 early afternoon PT) by EOD today.\n\nI’ll post the assembled pack in this channel and ping for the internal review when ready. Thanks team — we’re close to a clean handoff to the client. Priya",

We’ll aim to present all three directions and recommend a primary direction but keep options visible.\n\nNext steps / Action items (owner — due date)\n1) Drop final files — Alex — Aug 26\n   - Deliverables: hi-res desktop + mobile mockups for each direction (PNG + PDF) AND source frames in Figma.\n   - Add a 1-line summary per direction + recommended primary direction.\n   - File name & location: Luma_Hero_Concepts_2025-08-26 (upload to this channel and Figma link).\n\n2) Visual / dev cross-check — Sam — Aug 27\n   - Confirm any spacing/overlay constraints with header nav, note responsive breakpoints, and flag anything that affects compositing on staging.\n   - Post brief notes in-thread and link to staging prototype.\n\n3) Accessibility check — Mara & Priya — Aug 27\n   - Quick QA against drafted checklist: color contrast, heading structure, alt copy guidance for hero images. Post any blockers.\n\n4) Assemble client review pack — Priya — Aug 28\n   - Deliverables: 1-page summary per direction (desktop + mobile images), 1-line direction summary, recommended direction, accessibility notes, and a short script for client review.\n   - Output: single PDF + short slide deck uploaded to channel.\n\n5) Internal review meeting — All (Hannah to coordinate) — propose Aug 29, 10:00 AM PT\n   - Purpose: quick pass on pack, align recommendation, finalize notes to present to client.\n   - Please confirm availability or propose alternate times by EOD Aug 26.\n\n6) Client review (proposed) — Client meeting — Sept 2, 11:00 AM PT (tentative)\n   - Will confirm after internal sign-off.\n\nBlockers / Risks\n- Blocker: final export files and one-line summaries from Alex (prevents pack assembly).\n- Risk: client asks for additional directions in review -> scope creep. If that happens, I’ll propose a phased approach (present & pick direction, then iterate in a follow-on sprint with defined scope and timeline).\n\nRequests / Nudges\n- Alex: please upload the files + 1-line summaries by Aug 26 and tag @Priya.\n- Sam: drop your staging notes by Aug 27 and tag @Priya.\n- Hannah: please confirm internal review time or propose alternatives by EOD Aug 26.\n- Mara: confirm accessibility quick QA by Aug 27.\n\nDecision recap: prepare client review pack and run an internal sign-off before client presentation.\n\nNext steps: Owners above to confirm when tasks are done. I’ll assemble the pack after uploads and schedule the internal review once Hannah confirms time.\n\nIf anyone needs a different timeline, flag now and I’ll propose adjustments.",
