Provide PNG + optimized WebP.\n- Provide SVG of updated logo with padding token and a 32px and 48px raster fallback (logo_final.svg, logo_32.png, logo_48.png).\n- Include a set of 3 social crops (1:1, 4:5, 16:9) for hero_01.\n\n4) Accessibility & brand checks\n- Ensure CTA contrast ratio meets AA (contrast report attached would be great). Use brand-secondary #0B3A2E only for badges.\n- Use H1 weight 700, H2 600 per brand typographic scale.\n\n5) Legal flag\n- Any copy that claims “guaranteed” or “lifetime” needs legal sign-off. If you plan to use those words, flag them now — legal usually needs 2 business days.\n\n6) Next steps & timing\n- Can you send the updated exports and a brief version list by EOD Wednesday? If legal is involved, let me know immediately so we can queue review.\n- Also: status on the email header templates? Need those for QA by Friday.\n\nThanks — these are actionable for final export. If anything is blocked on files or specs, call it out. \n\n— Dana Brooks, Acme Outdoors",

Can you paste the full copy edits here or attach the final copy doc?\n2) Final deliverables & formats — we’ll prepare: web + print crops of the hero JPGs, ASE/PNG color swatches, source artboards (AI/PDF), and web-ready exports (PNG/WebP). Need any extra sizes (social aspect ratios, billboard, etc.)?\n3) File naming/versioning — we plan to export as hero_01_final.jpg / hero_02_final.jpg / hero_03_final.jpg. OK?\n4) Crops/usage — should we include a portrait/social crop for hero_03 or any alternate crops?\n5) Deadline — we can deliver final export bundle by end of day Monday (Aug 25). Does that work for you?\n\nOnce you confirm the copy edits and any extra format requests, we’ll queue the exports and share the download link. —Alex",

Can you paste the full copy edits here or attach the final copy doc?\n2) Final deliverables & formats — we’ll prepare: web + print crops of the hero JPGs, ASE/PNG color swatches, source artboards (AI/PDF), and web-ready exports (PNG/WebP). Need any extra sizes (social aspect ratios, billboard, etc.)?\n3) File naming/versioning — we plan to export as hero_01_final.jpg / hero_02_final.jpg / hero_03_final.jpg. OK?\n4) Crops/usage — should we include a portrait/social crop for hero_03 or any alternate crops?\n5) Deadline — we can deliver final export bundle by end of day Monday (Aug 25). Does that work for you?\n\nOnce you confirm the copy edits and any extra format requests, we’ll queue the exports and share the download link. —Alex"

I’ve reviewed the deliverables and am consolidating feedback, acceptance criteria, and next steps so we have a clear dev handoff and compliance posture.\n\n1) High-level ask\n- Please provide final Figma files and a single interactive prototype that reflect the agreed patterns for sign-in, account overview, secure messaging, appointment booking, and PHI display. I need artifacts and sign-offs aligned to the MVP milestone (Release Candidate for internal QA).\n\n2) User stories (MVP priority)\n- As a patient, I can securely sign in and view my upcoming appointments so I can prepare and confirm attendance.\n- As a patient, I can view my recent messages from clinicians and respond within an encrypted thread so I can manage communications without losing context.\n- As a patient, I can view my lab results with clear abnormality indicators and contextual help so I understand whether to contact my clinician.\n\n3) Acceptance criteria (for each user story)\n- Sign-in: Password and multi-factor auth flows are clearly shown; error states for invalid credentials and locked accounts are present; session timeout behavior described. Metrics: success path flows + error states covered (happy + 3 failure states).\n- Messaging: Messages are displayed chronologically; draft preservation across navigation; attachments handled with explicit consent flow. All PHI masked in previews where policy requires. Test accounts available for QA with seeded messages.\n- Lab results: Units, reference ranges, and trend sparkline included; abnormal values highlighted with color + text; “What this means” help copy available. Copy reviewed by clinical SME.\n\nDefinition of done (DoD) for design handoff\n- Finalized Figma file (all screens, components, and variants) with name: patient-portal_vFinal_2025-08-xx\n- Component library tokens exported (color, spacing, typography) and mapping to code tokens\n- Interaction specs (hover, focus, error states) annotated in Figma\n- Redline PDFs (print-ready) for dev: patient-portal_redlines_vFinal_2025-08-xx.pdf\n- Accessibility checklist & test cases (WCAG 2.1 AA) + expected behavior for screen readers\n- Security & privacy notes: where PHI is shown/stored, any requirements for encryption in transit/at rest\n- Clickable prototype link and version number\n- API contracts or mock endpoints for dev (or pointer to backlog tickets if already created)\n\n4) Accessibility, security, and regulatory considerations (must-have)\n- Accessibility: All pages must meet WCAG 2.1 AA. Provide ARIA roles, focus order, keyboard behaviors, and alt text for images. Provide a summary accessibility report and the list of outstanding WCAG issues (if any) with remediation plans.\n- Security/Privacy: Call out any screens that display PHI. Include requirements for session timeout, auto-logout, MFA prompts, and masking of PHI in notifications and previews. Must align with HIPAA/HITECH policies — provide notes for audit logging requirements and consent capture where required.\n- Data minimization: Identify fields that are PHI vs non-PHI and the expected retention/display rules.\n\n5) Constraints and assumptions\n- We assume backend supports paging and filters for large message sets. If not, state recommended UX fallback.\n- Assume we will not store unencrypted attachments on client-side caches; if UI suggests otherwise, provide mitigation.\n- Timezone normalization for appointment times must be specified in design copy.\n\n6) Handoff artifacts requested (upload to this channel or workspace)\n- Figma file: patient-portal_vFinal_2025-08-xx\n- Prototype URL + version\n- Redline PDF: patient-portal_redlines_vFinal_2025-08-xx.pdf\n- Component token export (.json or design-system format)\n- Accessibility checklist + screen-reader walkthrough doc\n- One-pager: Security & PHI handling notes\n- List of approved copy (clinical-approved) and source\n\n7) Approvals and reviewers\n- Please confirm the primary approvers for design: (1) Product (Samir), (2) Engineering lead, (3) Clinical SME, (4) Security/Privacy officer. I need explicit approval from all four for ‘release to dev handoff’.\n- Provide estimated dates when each approver can complete review.\n\n8) Timeline (proposed — confirm or update)\n- Finalized designs delivered: within 5 business days (proposed deadline: 2025-08-28)\n- Internal review and sign-off window: 3 business days\n- Dev handoff artifacts uploaded and flagged as ready: 2025-09-02\n- Release Candidate for QA: 2025-09-09\n\n9) Questions / requests for rationale\n- Please document the rationale for any non-standard navigation decisions (e.g., nested/hamburger menus on desktop), choice of persistent header vs in-page controls, and the decision matrix for when to mask PHI in lists vs details.\n- If tradeoffs were made to meet performance or dev constraints, list them explicitly so we can surface them in the implementation backlog.\n\n10) Next steps & ask\n- Upload the requested artifacts into this channel or share to the Meridian Design Studio workspace and tag @samir.patel.\n- Confirm approvers and their expected sign-off dates.\n- Provide the rationale for any unresolved UX decisions in a brief doc (1–2 paragraphs per decision).\n\nPlease respond with: 1) a confirmation of the above timeline or proposed changes, 2) the names/emails of approvers and their available review windows, and 3) a link to the uploaded artifacts (or a note if they will be delivered in stages).\n\nI will track approvals and raise any regulatory/security questions directly in-thread. If there are blockers that would affect the proposed dates, flag them now with impact and mitigation suggestions.\n\nThanks,\nSamir Patel\nProduct Manager — Patient Portal\nsamir.patel@healthtech.example.com",

If not, state recommended UX fallback.\n- Assume we will not store unencrypted attachments on client-side caches; if UI suggests otherwise, provide mitigation.\n- Timezone normalization for appointment times must be specified in design copy.\n\n6) Handoff artifacts requested (upload to this channel or workspace)\n- Figma file: patient-portal_vFinal_2025-08-xx\n- Prototype URL + version\n- Redline PDF: patient-portal_redlines_vFinal_2025-08-xx.pdf\n- Component token export (.json or design-system format)\n- Accessibility checklist + screen-reader walkthrough doc\n- One-pager: Security & PHI handling notes\n- List of approved copy (clinical-approved) and source\n\n7) Approvals and reviewers\n- Please confirm the primary approvers for design: (1) Product (Samir), (2) Engineering lead, (3) Clinical SME, (4) Security/Privacy officer. I need explicit approval from all four for ‘release to dev handoff’.\n- Provide estimated dates when each approver can complete review.\n\n8) Timeline (proposed — confirm or update)\n- Finalized designs delivered: within 5 business days (proposed deadline: 2025-08-28)\n- Internal review and sign-off window: 3 business days\n- Dev handoff artifacts uploaded and flagged as ready: 2025-09-02\n- Release Candidate for QA: 2025-09-09\n\n9) Questions / requests for rationale\n- Please document the rationale for any non-standard navigation decisions (e.g., nested/hamburger menus on desktop), choice of persistent header vs in-page controls, and the decision matrix for when to mask PHI in lists vs details.\n- If tradeoffs were made to meet performance or dev constraints, list them explicitly so we can surface them in the implementation backlog.\n\n10) Next steps & ask\n- Upload the requested artifacts into this channel or share to the Meridian Design Studio workspace and tag @samir.patel.\n- Confirm approvers and their expected sign-off dates.\n- Provide the rationale for any unresolved UX decisions in a brief doc (1–2 paragraphs per decision).\n\nPlease respond with: 1) a confirmation of the above timeline or proposed changes, 2) the names/emails of approvers and their available review windows, and 3) a link to the uploaded artifacts (or a note if they will be delivered in stages).\n\nI will track approvals and raise any regulatory/security questions directly in-thread. If there are blockers that would affect the proposed dates, flag them now with impact and mitigation suggestions.\n\nThanks,\nSamir Patel\nProduct Manager — Patient Portal\nsamir.patel@healthtech.example.com"

        "message": "@Dana @Alex @Priya Quick design handoff — final packaging status + two super-quick confirms so I don’t block delivery.\n\nWhat’s ready (confirmed)\n• Color palette — acme_color_palette_v3.ai ✅\n• Lifestyle hero set — hero_01.jpg / hero_02.jpg / hero_03.jpg ✅\n\nFiles I’ll export and drop in the final ZIP\n• Source: acme_brand_master.ai (AI + PDF)\n• Color specs: acme_color_palette_v3.ai + swatches ASE\n• Logos: acme_logo_horizontal.svg, acme_logo_stacked.svg, PNG exports (@1x/@2x)\n• Imagery: hero_01.jpg / hero_02.jpg / hero_03.jpg (web-optimized + 2x)\n• Social assets: hero_social_1200x628.jpg, profile_badge.png\n• Accessibility: alt-text CSV + contrast report (WCAG AA)\n• Figma handoff: https://www.figma.com/file/Acme/ACME-Handoff-v3 — dev frames + redlines\n\nTwo VERY quick confirms I need (yes/no) so I can export now:\n1) Hero headline to lock into exported hero JPGs — pick one: A) “Find Your Trail” OR B) “Adventure Awaits”\n2) Primary logo lockup for hero/lead placements — prefer HORIZONTAL or STACKED?\n\nOther asks / notes\n• Licensing: I included the image release docs in the Figma attachments — can someone (Dana) confirm usage/license is good-for-campaign? If I don’t hear back, I’ll flag for legal and hold social exports.\n• Default behavior if no reply by EOD tomorrow: I’ll export with Headline A (Find Your Trail) + HORIZONTAL lockup and deliver the ZIP so engineering can start.\n\nAccessibility & handoff notes\n• All hero text passes AA on darkest hero; I’ll add alt-text for every export and include contrast notes in the ZIP.\n• Dev-ready specs (spacings, font weights, color tokens) are on the Figma dev tab.\n\nPlanned drop: final ZIP with all files + README by EOD tomorrow once confirms are in.\n\nQuick thumbs: reply with the two yes/no choices (or say if you want a third option). Thanks — I’ll package immediately after the two confirms. 👋"
