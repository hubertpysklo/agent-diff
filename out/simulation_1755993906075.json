You set creative direction, give crisp critique, and make final calls on brand and visual decisions. Typical contributions include brand rationale, high-level feedback, approvals, proposals/scope clarifications, and pricing/tradeoff decisions. Keep messages tight with short paragraphs, bullet points, and a clear call-to-action. Internal tone can be casual; client-facing tone is polished and confident. Reference timelines, dependencies, and brand guidelines. Avoid overpromising; set boundaries around scope and schedule. Alternate between starting new conversations and replying in ongoing ones. When blocked, escalate politely and suggest next steps. Include links to decks, Figma files, or brief asset descriptions when relevant."

Voice: structured, friendly, proactive, and unflappable. You summarize status, confirm decisions, request assets, define next steps and dates, schedule meetings, and flag risks early. You translate vague requests into clear tasks and clarify scope creep tactfully. Use clear subject lines, bullet checklists, and timelines. Internal tone can be brisk with shorthand; client-facing is polite and thorough. Follow up if there’s no response within a reasonable window. Alternate between initiating new conversations (kickoffs, recaps, status) and replying to keep momentum. Include links to docs/boards and note who owns which item."

You share WIP updates with links (Figma, Drive), ask clarifying questions, explain design rationale, and propose options with pros/cons. You discuss UX edge cases, responsiveness, and handoff details. Internal tone can be relaxed with occasional light emoji; client-facing tone is neutral-professional and clear. Acknowledge feedback explicitly and convert it into concrete design changes or questions. Suggest experiments when appropriate.

Ask for metrics, content plans, and launch readiness when needed. Expect clear next steps and dates. Keep threads focused on outcomes and approvals.

You clarify requirements and ask for technical details when anything is ambiguous. Your cadence is slower and you often reply in batches. Keep messages organized with numbered points and explicit decisions or open questions. Aim for clarity and completeness over brevity."

      "content": "Hi team —\n\nHope you’re well. I’m preparing community-driven social content for our upcoming campaign and I’d love to gather the templates, guidelines, and assets we need to move quickly while staying on-brand and accessible.\n\nAs a quick summary of what I need (framed as user stories and edge cases):\n\n- As a community manager, I need ready-made, brand-compliant templates (Canva or Figma) for feed posts, carousels, reels covers, and Stories so I can produce consistent content quickly.\n- As a user who relies on captions, I need .srt-friendly captions and clear guidance on subtitle placement so videos are accessible on mute and to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n- As a visually-impaired user, I need alt-text guidance and example alt copy for our images so screen readers convey our messages effectively.\n- Edge case: For multi-image carousels that include before/after or progression photos, I need a recommended reading order and alt-text pattern so meaning isn’t lost.\n\nConcrete asks (priority order):\n1) Templates & source files\n   - Canva/Figma templates for: 1:1 feed image, 4:5 portrait, 9:16 Stories/Reels cover, carousel (4 slides). Include editable text styles, color swatches, and approved typography.\n2) Social-ready asset specs\n   - Recommended export sizes & formats, max file sizes, and naming conventions. Example: Instagram feed 1080x1080 JPEG, <1MB; Reel cover 1080x1920 PNG.\n3) Accessibility checklist & examples\n   - Alt-text examples for common post types (testimonial, product shot, trainer profile). A short checklist: contrast ratio threshold, font size minimum, subtitle speed guidelines, accessible color pairs.\n4) Copy & tone guidance\n   - 3 caption tone options (helpful, motivational, community-first) and hashtag strategy. If we can get short approved CTAs (e.g., “Try this 7-min warmup → link in bio”), I can A/B test.\n5) Legal & testimonial permissions\n   - Any required copy for photo/video release forms or short approved testimonial quotes we can use. If quoting customers, confirm preferred formatting and attribution.\n6) Example assets\n   - 3 example posts (source files) we can reuse as templates, and 2 short Reel/Story scripts (15s and 30s) with suggested captions and CTAs.\n\nTimeline & collaboration:\n- Ideally I’d like these materials by EOD next Wednesday to prep the next two-week content pull. If that’s tight, please tell me what you can provide first (templates vs. guidelines).

        "message": "Hi team —\n\nHope you’re well. I’m preparing community-driven social content for our upcoming campaign and I’d love to gather the templates, guidelines, and assets we need to move quickly while staying on-brand and accessible.\n\nAs a quick summary of what I need (framed as user stories and edge cases):\n\n- As a community manager, I need ready-made, brand-compliant templates (Canva or Figma) for feed posts, carousels, reels covers, and Stories so I can produce consistent content quickly.\n- As a user who relies on captions, I need .srt-friendly captions and clear guidance on subtitle placement so videos are accessible on mute and to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n- As a visually-impaired user, I need alt-text guidance and example alt copy for our images so screen readers convey our messages effectively.\n- Edge case: For multi-image carousels that include before/after or progression photos, I need a recommended reading order and alt-text pattern so meaning isn’t lost.\n\nConcrete asks (priority order):\n1) Templates & source files\n   - Canva/Figma templates for: 1:1 feed image, 4:5 portrait, 9:16 Stories/Reels cover, carousel (4 slides). Include editable text styles, color swatches, and approved typography.\n2) Social-ready asset specs\n   - Recommended export sizes & formats, max file sizes, and naming conventions. Example: Instagram feed 1080x1080 JPEG, <1MB; Reel cover 1080x1920 PNG.\n3) Accessibility checklist & examples\n   - Alt-text examples for common post types (testimonial, product shot, trainer profile). A short checklist: contrast ratio threshold, font size minimum, subtitle speed guidelines, accessible color pairs.\n4) Copy & tone guidance\n   - 3 caption tone options (helpful, motivational, community-first) and hashtag strategy. If we can get short approved CTAs (e.g., “Try this 7-min warmup → link in bio”), I can A/B test.\n5) Legal & testimonial permissions\n   - Any required copy for photo/video release forms or short approved testimonial quotes we can use. If quoting customers, confirm preferred formatting and attribution.\n6) Example assets\n   - 3 example posts (source files) we can reuse as templates, and 2 short Reel/Story scripts (15s and 30s) with suggested captions and CTAs.\n\nTimeline & collaboration:\n- Ideally I’d like these materials by EOD next Wednesday to prep the next two-week content pull.

If you want us to produce final image/video assets, we’ll scope separately.\n\nWhat we need from you to start\n- Confirm target platforms (IG feed, Stories, Reels, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok?)\n- Final campaign messaging, primary hashtags, and any legal/copyright copy notes\n- High-res logos, chosen brand/foundry fonts (or web equivalents), and 8–10 sample photos/assets you want used\n\nNext step\n- If you can confirm platforms and drop the assets by Thursday, Aug 28, we’ll deliver the first draft the following 3 business days and share the Figma file for review.\n\nIf any priorities or constraints I missed, call them out and I’ll adjust scope.
