Tightened horizontal rhythm to reduce whitespace on small screens.  \n- Hierarchy: H1 increased to 44/40 (desktop/mobile) and a slightly heavier weight to improve legibility at small sizes. Subhead reduced to improve scanning.  \n- CTAs: Primary (solid) moved to the left as the main action, secondary (ghost) to the right. Primary uses updated brand token with +4% contrast to meet WCAG AA on most backgrounds.  \n- Illustration & motion: Light parallax added on scroll; illustration has an accessible alt description baked into the component.  \n- Accessibility: focus states, 4:5 color contrast improvements, and keyboard order preserved. Tokens for colors and spacing included for dev handoff.  \n\nQuestions / asks (please prioritize 1–2 items):  \n1) Hierarchy: Is the H1 weight/scale readable at 320px? Any suggestions for scale/line-height?  \n2) CTA prominence: Does the primary feel dominant enough vs. illustration, or should we darken it further/introduce subtle shadow?  \n3) Illustration: Does the parallax motion distract from the CTA on initial load?  \n4) Accessibility check: Any color/focus issues you spot (I tested primary on white and a 10% gradient overlay)?  \n5) Responsive: Thoughts on the tablet breakpoint—should we collapse to a single column earlier?  \n\nNext steps: I’ll iterate to v3 based on feedback and push component tokens to the design system file. Please annotate directly in Figma or drop comments here — if you can, call out one thing that would block launch and one quick win.  \n\nThanks — Diego (v2)",

Confirm final SVG + 2x PNGs. \n- Primary color palette (contrast ratios meet WCAG AA for body text on background).\n- CTA treatment: Primary (solid) and Secondary (outline) variants + hover/focus states.\n\n2) UX/edge-case items to confirm\n- Dark mode variants: do we have inverted logos and adjusted CTA fills? Required for app and marketing pages.\n- Accessibility: font sizes, line-height, and color contrast for all breakpoints; confirm keyboard focus states.\n- Localization: provide RTL variants and font fallbacks for non-Latin scripts.\n- Low-bandwidth: SVG + compressed PNG fallback for email clients. Provide file size targets (<50KB for hero SVG where possible).\n\n3) A/B options I want for validation (please supply both options as quick Figma frames + exported PNGs)\n- CTA copy A: “Get started” vs B: “Request a demo”\n- Hero visual A: bold illustrative style (high personality) vs B: subdued photographic style (product-focused)\n\n4) Deliverables checklist (attach in one package)\n- Figma link with named frames for each A/B option\n- SVG + PNG @1x and @2x for each lockup, logo, and hero image\n- Tokens file (colors, typography, spacing) + contrast report\n- Short spec doc: usage rules, padding, clearspace, minimum sizes\n\n5) Metrics & experiment plan (proposal)\n- Run A/B for 2 weeks on homepage and landing pages\n- Metrics: click-through rate on primary CTA, sign-up conversion, bounce rate\n- Success threshold: +10% CTR or +5% conversion vs baseline\n\n6) Ownership & timeline\n- Who will own asset delivery? (Design owner + engineer reviewer)\n- Target for final assets into Figma: request by EOD Wednesday (3 business days)\n- If we miss that, propose one extra day with smaller scope (only hero + CTA copy)\n\nOpen questions for the team\n- Which user segment do we prioritize for the A/B test? New visitors vs returning? Recommend new visitors first.\n- Any legal/marketing constraints on hero copy or imagery? \n- Are we keeping the current default channel (client-aurora-brand) privacy settings? (no change requested unless you say otherwise)\n\nNext steps I propose\n- Design: upload Figma frames for A/B and package exports by Wed EOD\n- Product: confirm experiment owner + tracking events\n- Growth/Analytics: prepare baseline metrics and measurement plan\n\nPlease reply with: 1) owner(s) 2) ETA for the deliverables above 3) answers to the two open questions. If helpful, I can run a quick prototype test in staging — say yes/no and I’ll schedule.\n\nApprovals required: logo lockups, color palette, and primary CTA treatment.\n\nThanks — Priya",

New visitors vs returning? Recommend new visitors first.\n- Any legal/marketing constraints on hero copy or imagery? \n- Are we keeping the current default channel (client-aurora-brand) privacy settings? (no change requested unless you say otherwise)\n\nNext steps I propose\n- Design: upload Figma frames for A/B and package exports by Wed EOD\n- Product: confirm experiment owner + tracking events\n- Growth/Analytics: prepare baseline metrics and measurement plan\n\nPlease reply with: 1) owner(s) 2) ETA for the deliverables above 3) answers to the two open questions. If helpful, I can run a quick prototype test in staging — say yes/no and I’ll schedule.\n\nApprovals required: logo lockups, color palette, and primary CTA treatment.\n\nThanks — Priya"

I’ve also attached the latest hero WIP (v2) in design-critique: https://www.figma.com/file/EXAMPLE/acme-landing-hero?node-id=0%3A1\n\nProposed list (based on your note + what I can see):\n\n1) Brand asset drop (logo files, color palette, fonts, icon set)\n   - Owner: Diego Martín (Design)\n   - Deliverable: export-ready SVG/PNG logos, PDF color & type spec, icon sprites\n   - ETA: 48 hours (end of day, 2 business days)\n   - Notes: I’ll optimize for web (SVGs + 2 PNG sizes) and include accessible color contrast notes.\n\n2) Final hero copy approval\n   - Owner: Product / Content (please confirm owner)\n   - Deliverable: Signed-off H1, H2, CTA label(s)\n   - ETA: 1 business day after owner confirmation\n   - Notes: Slight layout adjustments in v2 depend on final copy length — I’ve left 2 responsive fallback lines in the Figma file.\n\n3) CTA behavior & tracking spec (primary/secondary, analytics event names)\n   - Owner: PM / Analytics (please confirm owner)\n   - Deliverable: CTA types + event names\n   - ETA: 2 business days after owner confirmation\n   - Notes: I can design both primary and secondary CTAs and provide dev-ready tokens once spec is confirmed.\n\n4) Final accessibility check (contrast, keyboard focus, ARIA labels)\n   - Owner: Design (Diego) + QA\n   - Deliverable: Accessibility checklist and fixes\n   - ETA: 1 business day after final assets + copy are confirmed\n\nOpen questions I still have (please confirm):\n- Target sprint date / hard launch deadline?\n- Who owns final content approval and analytics spec (name/email)?\n\nNext steps I’ll take once owners/answers are confirmed:\n- Complete brand asset export and drop into the shared drive (48h)\n- Finalize hero layout in Figma with copy + CTA variants\n- Export dev handoff package (tokens, SVGs, specs)\n\nIf helpful I can jump on a 15-min sync to assign owners and lock ETAs — what time works? Also happy to iterate v3 in the design-critique channel once you confirm the above.\n\n— Diego (sharing WIP, happy to revise quickly)",
