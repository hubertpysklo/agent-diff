This is leading to missed meds or extra app support requests.\n\nKey user quotes\n- “I set it for 8 AM but I don’t know if it’s a one-time thing or repeats.”\n- “I tapped ‘snooze’ but it still shows on my list — did it save?”\n\nProblems to solve (proposed)\n1) Make recurrence vs one-time explicit on the setup screen.\n2) Surface next scheduled reminder time clearly on the medication detail card.\n3) Clarify what happens when a user taps Snooze vs Dismiss (and show the snooze duration).\n4) Add a confirmation/undo affordance after changing reminder settings.\n\nAcceptance criteria (suggested)\n- When a user sets a reminder, the UI shows either “One-time • 8:00 AM • Apr 30” or “Daily • 8:00 AM • Every day” (no ambiguity).\n- Medication detail card shows “Next reminder: Tomorrow • 8:00 AM” or the exact next datetime for one-off reminders.\n- Tapping Snooze shows an in-place toast: “Snoozed for 10 minutes — Undo” (Undo available for 5s). Snooze duration defaults to 10m but is editable in settings.\n- Dismiss removes the current occurrence but does not change recurrence rules; an undo toast is available for 5s.\n- All changes persist reliably across app restarts and offline-then-online recoveries.\n\nCompliance and risk notes\n- All reminder text and timestamps must follow our PHI handling rules (no external logs with user-identifying medication names unless encrypted). Engineering: confirm whether current analytics/telemetry sends medication names — if so, we need to adjust telemetry or encrypt/protect.\n- Accessibility: ensure these changes are screen-reader friendly and that toast undo actions are reachable via keyboard and accessible focus.\n\nQuestions for the team / asks\n- Engineering: What backend work is needed to reliably compute and return the next-occurrence datetime (for one-off vs recurring)? Any storage schema changes? Estimate: small change (1–2 days) or larger?\n- Mobile: Can we show an undo toast with actionable button within our existing toast framework? Any platform limitations (iOS/Android)?\n- Design: I’ve sketched two options for the setup screen (explicit recurrence toggle vs inline recurrence label). Which is preferred for clarity/consistency? Can you share quick mockups by EOD Wednesday?\n- QA: Any test cases I’m missing for offline and timezone edge cases?\n\nProposed next steps\n- Engineers + design: quick feasibility sync (15–30m) this week. I’m available most days 8–4 CT — please suggest slots.\n- If feasible, target a small scoped iteration for the next sprint: UI copy + toast undo + next-occurrence display (no calendar redesign).\n\nPlease reply with feasibility estimates and any concerns. If you prefer, I can schedule the 15-min sync and include a one-page spec and the mockups.\n\nThanks — Jordan (Product Owner, Riverton Health).",

This is leading to missed meds or extra app support requests.\n\nKey user quotes\n- “I set it for 8 AM but I don’t know if it’s a one-time thing or repeats.”\n- “I tapped ‘snooze’ but it still shows on my list — did it save?”\n\nProblems to solve (proposed)\n1) Make recurrence vs one-time explicit on the setup screen.\n2) Surface next scheduled reminder time clearly on the medication detail card.\n3) Clarify what happens when a user taps Snooze vs Dismiss (and show the snooze duration).\n4) Add a confirmation/undo affordance after changing reminder settings.\n\nAcceptance criteria (suggested)\n- When a user sets a reminder, the UI shows either “One-time • 8:00 AM • Apr 30” or “Daily • 8:00 AM • Every day” (no ambiguity).\n- Medication detail card shows “Next reminder: Tomorrow • 8:00 AM” or the exact next datetime for one-off reminders.\n- Tapping Snooze shows an in-place toast: “Snoozed for 10 minutes — Undo” (Undo available for 5s). Snooze duration defaults to 10m but is editable in settings.\n- Dismiss removes the current occurrence but does not change recurrence rules; an undo toast is available for 5s.\n- All changes persist reliably across app restarts and offline-then-online recoveries.\n\nCompliance and risk notes\n- All reminder text and timestamps must follow our PHI handling rules (no external logs with user-identifying medication names unless encrypted). Engineering: confirm whether current analytics/telemetry sends medication names — if so, we need to adjust telemetry or encrypt/protect.\n- Accessibility: ensure these changes are screen-reader friendly and that toast undo actions are reachable via keyboard and accessible focus.\n\nQuestions for the team / asks\n- Engineering: What backend work is needed to reliably compute and return the next-occurrence datetime (for one-off vs recurring)? Any storage schema changes? Estimate: small change (1–2 days) or larger?\n- Mobile: Can we show an undo toast with actionable button within our existing toast framework? Any platform limitations (iOS/Android)?\n- Design: I’ve sketched two options for the setup screen (explicit recurrence toggle vs inline recurrence label). Which is preferred for clarity/consistency? Can you share quick mockups by EOD Wednesday?\n- QA: Any test cases I’m missing for offline and timezone edge cases?\n\nProposed next steps\n- Engineers + design: quick feasibility sync (15–30m) this week. I’m available most days 8–4 CT — please suggest slots.\n- If feasible, target a small scoped iteration for the next sprint: UI copy + toast undo + next-occurrence display (no calendar redesign).\n\nPlease reply with feasibility estimates and any concerns. If you prefer, I can schedule the 15-min sync and include a one-page spec and the mockups.\n\nThanks — Jordan (Product Owner, Riverton Health)."
