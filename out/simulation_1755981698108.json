Who owns labeling or vendor access?\n- Request: provide a reproducible seed + data snapshot; include exact query-time features used by current ranker.\n\nInfra / deployment asks\n- Infra: confirm availability of A/B slot and how many concurrent experiments we can run.\n- Sizing: need estimate of QPS for search (peak and average) so we can size re-ranker infra. If QPS > 50, re-ranker on CPU may be costly; need TPU/GPU inference or optimized CPUs.\n- CI: we need nightly offline eval runs and a canary path for rollout.\n\nImmediate requests (before 11am sprint planning)\n- Product (Priya): confirm top 2 user segments we should optimize this sprint and the canonical PRD link.\n- Infra: share current search QPS (avg/peak) and available A/B slots + GPU quota.\n- Frontend: rough estimate to implement cluster-and-collapse + ability to hide/de-emphasize cards (hours).\n- Volunteers: who can own data labeling coordination, re-ranker model, and frontend change? I can own model prototyping and offline evals.\n- Quick sync: propose 10:30am PT today for a 20-minute tech alignment before the 11am planning. If that works, I‚Äôll send a calendar invite.\n\nIf you want, I can post a concrete sprint backlog with tasks, owners, and rough estimates after we confirm infra & product priorities. Short and iterative is ideal ‚Äî pick one fast-ship (cluster collapse) + one research-ish re-ranker experiment.\n\nTL;DR: Fast win = de-dup/cluster; bigger win = second-stage re-ranker.

Use human-judgment set (target 2,000‚Äì3,000 labeled queries this sprint for reliable signal).\n- Online: primary: search satisfaction (self-report or task success) or CTR uplift on reformulated queries; secondary: latency P95, error rate.\n- Targets: aim for NDCG@10 +5% offline and user-sat +10% in A/B for full feature set; single sprint expect smaller gains (fast-win: visible reduction in noise).\n\nData & reproducibility asks\n- Product: confirm PRD priority and top user segments/queries to prioritize (link is in #product ‚Äî please confirm the canonical PRD link).\n- Data team: exports of search logs for last 3 months (query, clicked doc id, timestamps, user segment) and tooling to sample by tail/head.\n- Labeling: need budget for 2k‚Äì3k relevance labels + 5‚Äì10k intent labels this sprint. Who owns labeling or vendor access?\n- Request: provide a reproducible seed + data snapshot; include exact query-time features used by current ranker.\n\nInfra / deployment asks\n- Infra: confirm availability of A/B slot and how many concurrent experiments we can run.\n- Sizing: need estimate of QPS for search (peak and average) so we can size re-ranker infra. If QPS > 50, re-ranker on CPU may be costly; need TPU/GPU inference or optimized CPUs.\n- CI: we need nightly offline eval runs and a canary path for rollout.\n\nImmediate requests (before 11am sprint planning)\n- Product (Priya): confirm top 2 user segments we should optimize this sprint and the canonical PRD link.\n- Infra: share current search QPS (avg/peak) and available A/B slots + GPU quota.\n- Frontend: rough estimate to implement cluster-and-collapse + ability to hide/de-emphasize cards (hours).\n- Volunteers: who can own data labeling coordination, re-ranker model, and frontend change? I can own model prototyping and offline evals.\n- Quick sync: propose 10:30am PT today for a 20-minute tech alignment before the 11am planning. If that works, I‚Äôll send a calendar invite.\n\nIf you want, I can post a concrete sprint backlog with tasks, owners, and rough estimates after we confirm infra & product priorities. Short and iterative is ideal ‚Äî pick one fast-ship (cluster collapse) + one research-ish re-ranker experiment.\n\nTL;DR: Fast win = de-dup/cluster; bigger win = second-stage re-ranker. Need logs, labeling budget, QPS numbers, and an A/B slot. 10:30am sync?"

Keep best-scored doc per cluster.\n   - Why: removes obvious duplicates before reranking; minimal infra impact; quick offline validation.\n   - Implementation: offline embed store (FAISS/HNSW), clustering by radius sweep; parameterize threshold. Fallback exact-match dedup for titles/URLs.\n   - Expected infra cost: small (embedding lookup + clustering per-query). Latency delta: <10‚Äì30ms if optimized and cached.\n   - Offline metrics: duplicate_count@10, unique_results_ratio@10, precision@10, NDCG@10, reranker score distribution.\n\n2) Experiment B ‚Äî Diversity-aware reranker (next step if A insufficient)\n   - What: reranker that penalizes near-duplicate items (MMR-style) or a learned cross-encoder with diversity loss (or DPP approximate). Start with an MMR re-rank on embeddings as baseline; follow with small learned reranker (distilBERT or MonoT5 small) if needed.\n   - Why: better tradeoff between relevance and diversity; can surface less-noisy results without dropping relevance.\n   - Infra/latency: MMR cheap; learned reranker adds ~50‚Äì150ms depending on model. We can batch/cascade to reduce cost.\n   - Offline metrics: same as A plus tradeoff curves (precision vs diversity), latency P95.\n\nEvaluation & A/B plan\n- Primary metric: reduction in duplicate_rate@10 (or increase in unique_results_ratio@10).

Rough starting allocation: 10% traffic per variant x 14 days. If you share baseline rates I‚Äôll run power calc; ballpark: to detect ~5% relative lift we typically need O(10‚Äì50k) queries per arm depending on variance.\n\nOffline dataset & reproducibility\n- Need: 30‚Äì90 days anonymized query logs with candidate pools and click labels; held-out relevance labels (if any); corpus snapshot for embeddings.\n- I‚Äôll provide a reproducible eval harness: offline simulation ‚Üí candidate dedup ‚Üí rerank ‚Üí metrics. Please confirm we can log necessary fields (query id, variant id, rank list, click events).\n\nInfra & latency constraints\n- Latency budget: keep end-to-end P95 within current SLA (please confirm current P95). Target additions: Embedding dedup <30ms, MMR negligible; learned reranker add <=150ms (we should cascade).\n- Need staging env with representative QPS for 10% A/B and feature flag toggles; FAISS/HNSW index or embedding DB access for both staging and prod.\n\nImplementation owners & asks (please ack owners)\n- Product (Priya): confirm success metrics; provide labeled examples of ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù queries and UI decision (collapse duplicates or de-dup silently).\n- Backend Eng: implement candidate-stage dedup hook + feature flag; integrate embedding store and add logging.
