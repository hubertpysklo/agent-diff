      "content": "Quick follow-up to Lina's proposal — I can own an initial controlled benchmark and get actionable numbers (not just literature cites). High-level plan, open questions, and what I'll run first.\n\nGoal\n- Decide whether MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR gives consistent gains vs our baseline (SGD + step LR) on ResNet-50 under our infra and tuning budget.\n\nBenchmark design (controlled)\n- Model: ResNet-50 (same implementation we use in prod training code)\n- Dataset: ImageNet-1k (full) — if we want faster iteration we can use a 10% stratified subset for early signal\n- Metrics: Top-1 / Top-5 accuracy, train/val loss, calibration (ECE), training throughput (images/sec), peak GPU mem, and best checkpoint validation accuracy\n- Runs: 3 independent seeds per config (rng seeds: 42, 2025, 7) to estimate variance\n- Epochs: 90 (standard) for final; 10–20 epochs for smoke/subset\n- Batch size: match our current baseline (state the exact per-GPU or global batch — see question below)\n\nConfigs to compare\n- Baseline: SGD (momentum=0.9), weight_decay per our current config, step LR schedule (steps at 30/60), exact hyperparams copied from current baseline\n- Candidate: AdamW (decoupled WD; initial lr tuned), MixUp (alpha=0.2 as default; sweep alpha {0.1,0.2}), cosine LR schedule\n- Controlled hyps: try to keep other augmentations, regularization, label smoothing identical\n\nSmall experiment (smoke / sanity)\n- What I'll run first: 1) single 8-GPU smoke run for 10 epochs for each config to ensure no bugs and to measure throughput. 2) 3-run 20-epoch pilot on a 10% subset to estimate directionality and variance.\n\nRepro / env\n- Seed: 42/2025/7 for final runs\n- Env: PyTorch 2.1 (or our current), CUDA 11.8, torchvision X.Y (match repo); will attach exact pip freeze and Dockerfile\n- Checkpoints/logs: store to our training bucket under /benchmarks/mixup_adamw_cosine/resnet50/<date>\n\nCompute estimate (rough)\n- Smoke runs (10 epochs, 8xA100): ~1 GPU-hour per run => trivial\n- Pilot 20% subset 20 epochs, 8xA100, 3 seeds: ~12–18 GPU-hours\n- Full final grid (3 seeds × 90 epochs × 2 configs × maybe 2 alpha values): 3×90×2×8 GPUs-ish — rough estimate: 600–900 GPU-hours total (depends on batch and hardware).\n- Callout: accuracy differences can be small; we need the 3-run final experiments to be confident.\n\nLogging and analysis\n- Produce training curves, final checkpoints, and a short report with paired significance (t-test on seeds) + calibration plots and throughput numbers.\n\nQuestions / decisions I need from you\n1) Dataset: proceed with full ImageNet or do we prefer a fixed validation subset for quicker experiments?  \n2) Baseline exact hyperparams: can someone paste the current SGD config (lr, batch size global or per GPU, weight decay, label smoothing)? I will replicate those exactly.\n3) Hardware target: 8xA100 for final runs OK? Or should I plan for 4xV100? This changes GPU-hour estimate.\n4) Any constraints on model size / memory (we must ensure AdamW + MixUp fit with our batch sizes)?\n\nPlanned timeline\n- Today: implement configs and run smoke tests on 8 GPUs (10 epochs). 1 day.  \n- +2–3 days: run 3-seed pilot on 10% subset and produce preliminary report.  \n- +1 week: finalize full runs (assuming compute queue available) and publish final comparison report.\n\nWhat I'll try next\n- I’ll create the training configs (diff vs baseline), push them to the bench repo, run the smoke tests (10 epochs) tonight, and post logs + throughput numbers here. If smoke fails I’ll post the error/debug logs and a small diff.\n\nUnknowns / risks\n- Mixed results in literature: improvements depend on batch size and weight-decay tuning; we should be cautious about direct adopt.  \n- AdamW can change optimal weight decay & lr; need a small lr/Wd sweep or risk under/over-regularizing.\n\nIf this sounds good I’ll start now. Lina / team: please paste the canonical baseline training config (or link to it) and confirm hardware. I’ll circle back with smoke run logs and a short benchmark plan doc.\n\n— Diego (I’ll post daily-standup afterwards with yesterday/today/blockers)",

High-level plan, open questions, and what I'll run first.\n\nGoal\n- Decide whether MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR gives consistent gains vs our baseline (SGD + step LR) on ResNet-50 under our infra and tuning budget.\n\nBenchmark design (controlled)\n- Model: ResNet-50 (same implementation we use in prod training code)\n- Dataset: ImageNet-1k (full) — if we want faster iteration we can use a 10% stratified subset for early signal\n- Metrics: Top-1 / Top-5 accuracy, train/val loss, calibration (ECE), training throughput (images/sec), peak GPU mem, and best checkpoint validation accuracy\n- Runs: 3 independent seeds per config (rng seeds: 42, 2025, 7) to estimate variance\n- Epochs: 90 (standard) for final; 10–20 epochs for smoke/subset\n- Batch size: match our current baseline (state the exact per-GPU or global batch — see question below)\n\nConfigs to compare\n- Baseline: SGD (momentum=0.9), weight_decay per our current config, step LR schedule (steps at 30/60), exact hyperparams copied from current baseline\n- Candidate: AdamW (decoupled WD; initial lr tuned), MixUp (alpha=0.2 as default; sweep alpha {0.1,0.2}), cosine LR schedule\n- Controlled hyps: try to keep other augmentations, regularization, label smoothing identical\n\nSmall experiment (smoke / sanity)\n- What I'll run first: 1) single 8-GPU smoke run for 10 epochs for each config to ensure no bugs and to measure throughput. 2) 3-run 20-epoch pilot on a 10% subset to estimate directionality and variance.\n\nRepro / env\n- Seed: 42/2025/7 for final runs\n- Env: PyTorch 2.1 (or our current), CUDA 11.8, torchvision X.Y (match repo); will attach exact pip freeze and Dockerfile\n- Checkpoints/logs: store to our training bucket under /benchmarks/mixup_adamw_cosine/resnet50/<date>\n\nCompute estimate (rough)\n- Smoke runs (10 epochs, 8xA100): ~1 GPU-hour per run => trivial\n- Pilot 20% subset 20 epochs, 8xA100, 3 seeds: ~12–18 GPU-hours\n- Full final grid (3 seeds × 90 epochs × 2 configs × maybe 2 alpha values): 3×90×2×8 GPUs-ish — rough estimate: 600–900 GPU-hours total (depends on batch and hardware).\n- Callout: accuracy differences can be small; we need the 3-run final experiments to be confident.\n\nLogging and analysis\n- Produce training curves, final checkpoints, and a short report with paired significance (t-test on seeds) + calibration plots and throughput numbers.\n\nQuestions / decisions I need from you\n1) Dataset: proceed with full ImageNet or do we prefer a fixed validation subset for quicker experiments?  \n2) Baseline exact hyperparams: can someone paste the current SGD config (lr, batch size global or per GPU, weight decay, label smoothing)? I will replicate those exactly.\n3) Hardware target: 8xA100 for final runs OK? Or should I plan for 4xV100? This changes GPU-hour estimate.\n4) Any constraints on model size / memory (we must ensure AdamW + MixUp fit with our batch sizes)?\n\nPlanned timeline\n- Today: implement configs and run smoke tests on 8 GPUs (10 epochs). 1 day.  \n- +2–3 days: run 3-seed pilot on 10% subset and produce preliminary report.  \n- +1 week: finalize full runs (assuming compute queue available) and publish final comparison report.\n\nWhat I'll try next\n- I’ll create the training configs (diff vs baseline), push them to the bench repo, run the smoke tests (10 epochs) tonight, and post logs + throughput numbers here. If smoke fails I’ll post the error/debug logs and a small diff.\n\nUnknowns / risks\n- Mixed results in literature: improvements depend on batch size and weight-decay tuning; we should be cautious about direct adopt.  \n- AdamW can change optimal weight decay & lr; need a small lr/Wd sweep or risk under/over-regularizing.\n\nIf this sounds good I’ll start now. Lina / team: please paste the canonical baseline training config (or link to it) and confirm hardware. I’ll circle back with smoke run logs and a short benchmark plan doc.\n\n— Diego (I’ll post daily-standup afterwards with yesterday/today/blockers)"

      "content": "TL;DR — Clear acceptance criteria, owners, and timeline so we can decide whether to adopt MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR at scale.\n\nSummary\n- Lina proposed a controlled benchmark vs our baseline (ResNet-50, SGD + step LR). Diego has an executable run plan and will own the initial runs. Samir will make results actionable for product/stakeholders.\n\nGoals (what decision we want)\n- Decide whether to adopt MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR at scale for ResNet-50 workloads based on empirical evidence considering accuracy, training cost, and reproducibility.\n\nProposed acceptance criteria (please review / flag changes)\n1) Accuracy\n   - Primary: absolute top-1 validation accuracy improvement >= 0.5% vs baseline OR statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) across N=5 seeds.\n   - Secondary: top-5 accuracy should not degrade by >0.2%.\n2) Training cost & resource impact\n   - Wall-clock training time increase <= 10% OR improvement justified by >0.75% top-1 gain if time >10%.\n   - Peak GPU memory increase <= 10%.\n3) Stability & variance\n   - Across N=5 random seeds, standard deviation of top-1 must be <= baseline std + 0.5% absolute. If variance is larger, require larger accuracy gains to offset uncertainty.\n4) Reproducibility\n   - All configs (training script, hyperparams, seed list), Docker/container env, and logs pushed to the benchmark repo and linked in the results dashboard. A single command must reproduce a run.\n5) Overall adoption decision\n   - If criteria 1–4 are met, recommend adoption for ResNet-50; if mixed (e.g., small gain but higher cost), recommend a staged rollout or further tuning on other models/datasets before scaling.\n\nBenchmarks & measurement details (to be used for runs)\n- Dataset: confirm — ImageNet v1 (or internal variant?). (Question below.)\n- Model: ResNet-50, same codebase/version as baseline (link config/ticket: please confirm current baseline config ticket/PR).\n- Seeds: N=5 distinct random seeds per config.\n- Metrics logged: top-1, top-5 (val), training & epoch wall-clock, GPU mem, LR schedule, optimizer state dicts, train/val loss curves. Save checkpoints.\n- Statistical test: paired t-test across seeds for top-1.\n\nOwners & timeline\n- Diego Álvarez — owner of initial controlled runs and configs. Target: complete runs and push raw logs within 5 business days.\n- Samir O’Neill — owner of visuals & concise results dashboard. Target: dashboard ready within 3 business days after Diego’s raw results are available.\n- Lina Sørensen — owner of methodology review and confirmation of experimental design; please confirm MixUp alpha and any augmentation details we should keep/change.\n- Maya (me) — run coordinator, will schedule a 30-min sync to decide adoption within 2 business days after dashboard is ready.\n\nDependencies & blockers\n- Compute quota: confirm we have the required GPUs for parallel runs (Diego, can you list GPUs + estimated hours?).\n- Baseline config link: share exact baseline training config/version so runs are controlled.\n- Dataset version: confirm ImageNet v1 vs internal; if internal, provide dataset commit hash.\n\nOpen questions / decisions needed\n1) Dataset: ImageNet v1 or internal variant? (Lina/Diego)\n2) MixUp hyperparams: MixUp alpha default = 0.2? Any other alpha values to sweep? (Lina)\n3) AdamW specifics: weight decay and betas — use literature defaults or sweep? Proposed: AdamW with weight decay = 0.01, betas=(0.9,0.999). (Diego/Lina)\n4) Number of seeds: confirm N=5.

        "message": "TL;DR — Clear acceptance criteria, owners, and timeline so we can decide whether to adopt MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR at scale.\n\nSummary\n- Lina proposed a controlled benchmark vs our baseline (ResNet-50, SGD + step LR). Diego has an executable run plan and will own the initial runs. Samir will make results actionable for product/stakeholders.\n\nGoals (what decision we want)\n- Decide whether to adopt MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR at scale for ResNet-50 workloads based on empirical evidence considering accuracy, training cost, and reproducibility.\n\nProposed acceptance criteria (please review / flag changes)\n1) Accuracy\n   - Primary: absolute top-1 validation accuracy improvement >= 0.5% vs baseline OR statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) across N=5 seeds.\n   - Secondary: top-5 accuracy should not degrade by >0.2%.\n2) Training cost & resource impact\n   - Wall-clock training time increase <= 10% OR improvement justified by >0.75% top-1 gain if time >10%.\n   - Peak GPU memory increase <= 10%.\n3) Stability & variance\n   - Across N=5 random seeds, standard deviation of top-1 must be <= baseline std + 0.5% absolute. If variance is larger, require larger accuracy gains to offset uncertainty.\n4) Reproducibility\n   - All configs (training script, hyperparams, seed list), Docker/container env, and logs pushed to the benchmark repo and linked in the results dashboard. A single command must reproduce a run.\n5) Overall adoption decision\n   - If criteria 1–4 are met, recommend adoption for ResNet-50; if mixed (e.g., small gain but higher cost), recommend a staged rollout or further tuning on other models/datasets before scaling.\n\nBenchmarks & measurement details (to be used for runs)\n- Dataset: confirm — ImageNet v1 (or internal variant?). (Question below.)\n- Model: ResNet-50, same codebase/version as baseline (link config/ticket: please confirm current baseline config ticket/PR).\n- Seeds: N=5 distinct random seeds per config.\n- Metrics logged: top-1, top-5 (val), training & epoch wall-clock, GPU mem, LR schedule, optimizer state dicts, train/val loss curves. Save checkpoints.\n- Statistical test: paired t-test across seeds for top-1.\n\nOwners & timeline\n- Diego Álvarez — owner of initial controlled runs and configs. Target: complete runs and push raw logs within 5 business days.\n- Samir O’Neill — owner of visuals & concise results dashboard. Target: dashboard ready within 3 business days after Diego’s raw results are available.\n- Lina Sørensen — owner of methodology review and confirmation of experimental design; please confirm MixUp alpha and any augmentation details we should keep/change.\n- Maya (me) — run coordinator, will schedule a 30-min sync to decide adoption within 2 business days after dashboard is ready.\n\nDependencies & blockers\n- Compute quota: confirm we have the required GPUs for parallel runs (Diego, can you list GPUs + estimated hours?).\n- Baseline config link: share exact baseline training config/version so runs are controlled.\n- Dataset version: confirm ImageNet v1 vs internal; if internal, provide dataset commit hash.\n\nOpen questions / decisions needed\n1) Dataset: ImageNet v1 or internal variant? (Lina/Diego)\n2) MixUp hyperparams: MixUp alpha default = 0.2? Any other alpha values to sweep? (Lina)\n3) AdamW specifics: weight decay and betas — use literature defaults or sweep? Proposed: AdamW with weight decay = 0.01, betas=(0.9,0.999). (Diego/Lina)\n4) Number of seeds: confirm N=5. If cost constrained, we can do N=3 but this weakens statistical power.\n5) Acceptance thresholds: are the numeric thresholds above acceptable or too strict/lenient? (All)\n\nNext steps (concrete)\n- Diego: post the final run command + estimated compute hours and GPU types by EOD today. Start runs once compute is confirmed.\n- Lina: confirm dataset and MixUp/AdamW hyperparams by EOD today.\n- Samir: prepare dashboard template (metrics + visuals) and share layout before results arrive so Diego can ensure logs capture needed fields.\n- Maya: will book a 30-min decision sync 2 business days after dashboard completion.\n\nIf everyone agrees with the acceptance criteria and owners, we’ll move forward.

Decision to adopt MixUp + AdamW + cosine LR at scale will be based on clear, quantitative acceptance criteria below. Diego will run the experiments; Samir will produce a concise dashboard; Lina will validate the experimental setup. I’ll synthesize results and call the adoption decision.\n\nAcceptance criteria (unambiguous decision rule)\n1. Primary metric: top-1 validation accuracy on our ResNet-50 benchmark dataset.\n   - Adoption if MixUp+AdamW+cosine yields an absolute mean improvement of >= 0.5% over baseline (SGD + step LR) AND the 95% confidence intervals (across N=3 independent seeds) do not overlap.\n2. Secondary checks (must not regress):\n   - Training cost: total GPU-hours (or $ cost) increase <= 10% vs baseline. If >10% improvement in accuracy is required to justify higher cost.\n   - Calibration (ECE): no worse than baseline by >0.01 absolute.\n   - Worst-class recall: no class drops >2 percentage points.\n3. Stability: observed gains must be consistent across 3 independent seeds and not rely on per-run hyperparameter tuning.\n4. Implementation & infra: training recipe must be reproducible from config files in the repo (see DOC-ENG- MixUp-BM) and pass CI reproduce check.\n\nIf all the above hold, we adopt the new recipe for ResNet-50 training and plan a follow-up road‑map item to evaluate cross-architecture generalization.\n\nControlled benchmark definition (what to keep fixed)\n- Dataset, preprocessing pipeline, model code (ResNet-50), random-seed handling, data shuffling, batch size, total training steps/epochs, logging/metrics hooks.\n- Only variables allowed to change: augmentation (MixUp on/off), optimizer (AdamW vs SGD), LR schedule (cosine vs step), and any optimizer-specific hyperparameters (documented in config).\n- Full config files and hyperparams go into ticket TKT-789 and doc DOC-ENG-MixUp-BM (please link if you have updated names).\n\nRun plan (high level)\n- Baseline reproducibility: Diego to reproduce our current SGD+step LR baseline (1 seed) and confirm parity with historical metrics. (Why: sanity check.)\n- Controlled runs: 3 seeds each for baseline and candidate (MixUp+AdamW+cosine). Keep everything else fixed.\n- Additional variants (only if time permits): ablations for MixUp only, AdamW only, cosine only.\n\nOwners & deadlines\n- Diego Álvarez: run baseline reproducibility + controlled runs (3 seeds each); push configs and raw logs to /experiments/mixup-bench. Due: initial runs complete by Mon Aug 26 (EOD). Final controlled runs and logs by Fri Aug 30.\n- Dr. Lina Sørensen: validate experimental protocol and review configs before large runs (review complete by Thu Aug 22). If that date already passed, please confirm now.\n- Samir O’Neill: create visual dashboard (top-level one-pager + short copy for PM/eng leadership). Draft dashboard by Mon Sep 2.\n- Maya (me): synthesize results, write recommendation, and schedule decision sync if needed. Decision target: Wed Sep 3 (or earlier if strong signal).\n\nDefinition of Done (DoD) for the benchmark\n- Repo contains runnable configs for baseline and candidate (paths + commit hash).\n- All runs (3 seeds each) completed, logs uploaded, and training cost measured.\n- Dashboard created with: mean+CI for top-1, training cost, ECE, per-class worst-case recalls, and ablation notes if run.\n- Review signoffs: Diego (data), Lina (experiment design), Samir (dashboard clarity), Maya (product decision readiness).\n\nDependencies & risks\n- Compute quota: Diego — confirm required GPU-hours and quota availability. If quota constrained, we may reduce seeds to 2 but then raise acceptance thresholds.\n- Hyperparameter sensitivity: AdamW and MixUp interact; risk that gains are due to hand-tuned HPs rather than general recipe. Mitigation: use same HP selection process for baseline and candidate; avoid per-run retuning.\n- Dataset bias: results on ResNet-50 may not generalize to other model families. Plan a follow-up cross-arch check if we adopt.\n\nQuestions / asks (please reply inline)\n1. Diego — confirm you can finish reproducible baseline by Mon Aug 26 and full runs by Aug 30. How many GPU-hours do you need? Any quota blockers?\n2. Lina — please confirm the final config checklist or point to the authoritative doc/ticket for configs (DOC/TKT links above). If the validation step is already done, say “validated”.\n3. Samir — will the dashboard template you sketched support the CI-level reproducibility links (commit hashes + raw logs)? Do you need any data schema from Diego?\n4. Anyone — do we want to include a small additional dataset (e.g., dataset X) as a quick generalization check, or keep scope tight to ResNet-50 for this first decision?\n\nNext immediate steps (today)\n- Diego: post estimated GPU-hours + any quota ask here.\n- Lina: confirm config doc/ticket link or mark as validated.\n- Samir: confirm dashboard format and whether you need any extra data fields.\n\nI’ll keep this thread as the single source of truth — please reply to the relevant bullet so we stay organized. If there’s no major blocker, we’ll proceed on the timeline above and aim to decide by Sep 3.\n\nThanks — Maya",
