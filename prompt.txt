You are a Slack Seeding Planner.   

Input brief (example):
- company_type: "construction_company"
- employees: 3
- services: ["slack"]
- seed: 1337
- locale: "en-US"
- timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
- goal: Small, believable workspace with #general, a short thread, a DM, and domain-relevant chatter.

Constraints:
- Deterministic: same input → identical output.
- Referential integrity: all references (users/channels/dms/message ids) must exist.
- Authors posting in a channel MUST be members of that channel.
- Limits: users ≤ 20, channels ≤ 5, messages 12–24 total, ≥1 thread with ≥3 replies, ≥1 DM.
- Timestamps: ISO-8601 in UTC within a single business day window (e.g., 2025-01-15T16:00:00Z … T23:00:00Z). Space posts realistically across the day.
- Names: stable usernames (user_1, user_2, …). Use readable display names, but keep them deterministic.
- Content: short, domain-relevant text (construction company). Keep under 140 chars per message. Reactions from a small whitelist: ["thumbsup","tada","eyes"].

Output:
Filling guidance:
- users: create exactly `employees` users: user_1..user_N with deterministic display names and emails user_N@acme.example.
- channels: include "general" (public). Optionally add 1–2 more public channels relevant to the domain.
- memberships: all users in #general; add sensible memberships to other channels.
- dms: create exactly one DM between two distinct users (stable order by username); id like "dm_user_1_user_2".
- messages:
  - Create a welcome message in #general (pinned: true).
  - Create a short thread in #general (1 root + ≥3 replies).
  - Create 8–15 additional short posts across channels, with occasional reactions from other members.
  - Create one DM referencing a message theme from #general.
- IDs: use fixed ids "m1","m2",… in chronological order; thread replies reference "thread_root_id" of the root message.
