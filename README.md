# Diff the Universe

Evaluate AI agents by testing them against fake versions of real services.

## Background

The idea came from the YC AI Agents Hackathon 2025 with my Wordware colleagues. We kept hitting rate limits and losing control of test state while building evaluation systems at Wordware. The hackathon prototype proved the concept - fake services you can fully control. Now building it properly from scratch.
